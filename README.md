## Introduction

Rocketbelt is a pattern library that addresses recurring design problems across the ecommerce landscape.

It strives to be a comprehensive, living document that serves the **clarity** of design decisions. It facilitates a **shared vocabulary** and therefore a **shared understanding** of user interfaces.

The pattern library guarantees consistency in the online experience--critical since the experience is the brand.

Rocketbelt ensures UI components are reusable, efficient, and easily maintained. It accelerates UI development by providing building blocks to quickly build potentially complicated interactions. The pattern library allows rapid prototyping to also be high fidelity.

## Features

- SASS-based patterns
- Auto-updating, inline code snippets
- Flexbox grid & component layouts
- Responsive & mobile-first
- User-definable browser support & prefix-free development
- Easy cross-browser/cross-device testing via [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/)
- Coming soon: Automated visual regression tests of all patterns
