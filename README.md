Introduction
------------
Rocketbelt is a pattern library that addresses recurring design problems across the ecommerce landscape.

It strives to be a comprehensive, living document that serves the __clarity__ of design decisions. It facilitates a __shared vocabulary__ and therefore a __shared understanding__ of user interfaces.

The pattern library guarantees consistency in the online experience—critical since the experience is the brand.

Rocketbelt ensures UI components are reusable, efficient, and easily maintained. It accelerates UI development by providing building blocks to quickly build potentially complicated interactions. The pattern library allows rapid prototyping to also be high fidelity.

Features
