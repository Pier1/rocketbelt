Anchor text should be [short]{.emphasize}, [clear]{.emphasize}, and
[action-focused]{.emphasize}. Avoid vague link text like *"Learn More"* or
*"Read More"* at all costs—such language creates ambiguity because of its poor
information scent and introduces serious accessibility issues.[^2]

_Anchors go places, buttons do things._ `href="#"`, `href="javascript:void(0);"`
and click listeners attached to links are antipatterns. Consider using <Link
to="/components/actions-and-feedback/buttons">Buttons</Link> in these
cases.

## Standard Links
```html
<a href="pier1.com">Find a Pier 1</a> near you.
```

## Links with Icons
Note `aria-hidden` attribute in the example below. The icon can safely be hidden
from assistive technology only because the icon is decorative and because the
anchor text is clear and descriptive of the action to be taken.

```html
<a class="text-with-icon" href="#">Chat Now
  <svg class="icon icon-right" aria-hidden>
    <use xlink:href="/icons/rocketbelt.icons.svg#rb-icon-chat-single"></use>
  </svg>
</a>
```

## CTAs
Calls to Action (CTAs) should be visually distinct from the content adjacent to
them. CTA copy should be _compelling-but-concise_, imperative, and a natural
conclusion of the content that leads to the CTA.

```html
<a class="cta text-with-icon" href="#">
  <span class="cta_text">Shop Dining & Entertaining</span>
</a>
```

## Link Lists
Use the Link List component to visually group links that are logically
related, such as navigational elements in a header or footer.
```html
<ul class="link-list">
  <li class="title"><a class="cta" target="_blank" href="https://www.pier1.com/pillows">Pillows</a></li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pier1.com/embroidered_pillows">Textured & Embellished Pillows</a></li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pier1.com/solid_pillows">Solid Pillows</a></li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pier1.com/pattern_pillows">Patterned Pillows</a></li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pier1.com/outdoor_pillows">Outdoor Pillows</a></li>
</ul>
```
