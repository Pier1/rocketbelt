# Uploaders
Include `rocketbelt.uploaders.js` and call
`rb.uploaders.addUploader({ selector: '#unique-selector' })` to initialize.

As files are added via the UI, they're also added to the array as base64-encoded
strings along with the file size and an auto-generated ID. The uploader emits
`rb.uploaders.fileAdded` and `rb.uploaders.fileRemoved` events as files are
added and removed.

By default, the uploader stores images as base64-encoded
strings. It can be configured to append files as `Blob`s by adding the parameter
`filesAsBinary: true` to the configuration object when the uploader is created.
