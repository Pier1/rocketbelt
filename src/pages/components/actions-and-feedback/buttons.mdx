# Buttons
_Anchors go places, buttons do things._ Use a Button to **perform an action**
on the page.


<section>

## Default/Secondary Buttons

```html
<button class="button">Secondary</button>
<button class="button" disabled>Disabled</button>
<button class="button button-sm">Small</button>
<button class="button button-mini">Mini</button>
```

</section>

<section>

## Primary Buttons
Use a Primary Button to convey a preferred action. With very rare exception
there should never be more than one Primary Button present per page or large
logical component.

When Primary & Secondary Buttons are grouped together, always place the Primary
Button on the right.

```html
<button class="button button-primary">Primary</button>
<button class="button button-primary" disabled>Disabled</button>
<button class="button button-sm button-primary">Small</button>
<button class="button button-mini button-primary">Mini</button>
```

<section class="subsection">

### Paired with a Secondary Button
```html
<button class="button">Secondary Action</button>
<button class="button button-primary">Primary Action</button>
```

</section>
</section>

<section>

## Text/Minimal Buttons
A Text Button can represent a primary action if placed by itself in a visually
small component. Text Buttons may be grouped with other Text Buttons or with a
Primary Button. If a Text Button is grouped with a Primary Button, always
use the Text Button to represent the secondary action.

```html
<button class="button button-text">Text Button</button>
<button class="button button-text" disabled>Disabled</button>
<button class="button button-sm button-text">Small Text</button>
<button class="button button-mini button-text">Mini Text</button>
```

<section class="subsection">

### Paired with a Primary Button
```html
<button class="button button-text">Secondary Action</button>
<button class="button button-primary">Primary Action</button>
```

## Block Buttons
Block Buttons may be used on mobile to give a page a more app-like feel and to
increase touch target size. Consider using the
[Flexible Grid](../structure/flexible-grid) to auto-size buttons and to allow
them to stack at narrower viewport widths.

```html
<div class="grid-fluid">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col xs-12 md-6">
      <button class="button button-block">Block</button>
    </div>
    <div class="col xs-12 md-6">
      <button class="button button-primary button-block">Block</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

</section>

## Anchor Buttons
In exceedingly rare cases, an anchor tag may have existing click functionality
attached to it that performs an action rather than triggering navigation. In
such cases, be sure to add the `role="button"` attribute to the element so it
is properly identified by assistive technology.

```html
<a class="button button-primary" href="#" role="button">
  Anchor Button
</a>
<a class="button button-primary" disabled href="#" role="button">
  Disabled
</a>
<a class="button button-sm button-primary" href="#" role="button">
  Small Anchor
</a>
<a class="button button-mini button-primary" href="#" role="button">
  Mini Anchor
</a>
```

</section>
<section>

## role="button" Elsewhere
It may seem logical to add `role="button"` to non-semantic elements that have
attached click handlers to expose them to assistive technologies like screen
readers. Keep in mind, though, that non-semantic elements are by nature not
reachable via keyboard. While this can be remedied via adding a `tabindex`
attribute, it's universally a better idea to use a `<button>` element instead.
_Anchors go places, buttons do things._
