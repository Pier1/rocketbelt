# Busy Indicators
> Make the slow less insufferable.

Showing a Busy Indicator gives the user confidence that the
system received their request and is still working on it. Display a Busy
Indicator any time an action takes longer than **1 second** to complete.
(Actions that finish in 100 milliseconds or less are perceived as being
instantaneous.[^1])

### "Is Busyable"
The `is-busyable` class is fundamental to using Rocketbelt's Busy Indicators.
Add it to a container that wraps whatever may be marked as busy. This class
greatly narrows the scope of DOM elements that will be watched by a
`MutationObserver` that shows & hides the indicator. If no element matches
`.is-busyable`, the observer will be registered against `body` (this is an
antipattern and will negatively impact performance).

### Component-Level
Use a **Component-Level** Indicator to mark smaller pieces of UI as busy, such as
buttons or form elements.

Component-Level Indicators come in **spinner** and **inverted** variations.

<ToggleClassButton
  selector={`.button:not(.button-copy)`}
  classToToggle={`is-busy`}
/>

```html
<button class="button is-busyable is-busy">Default</button>
<button class="button is-busyable is-busy is-busy-spinner is-busy-opaque">Spinner</button>
<button class="button button-primary is-busyable is-busy is-busy-inverted">Inverted</button>
```

### Page-Level
To mark an entire page (or a very large component) as busy, add both
`is-busyable` and `is-busyable-page` classes. An optional busy message can be
shown by adding a `data-rb-is-busy-message` attribute to the same containing
element (see the example below). The message will be shown after a configurable delay specified in
data-rb-is-busy-message-after-seconds. The message will be shown immediately
if this attribute isn't specified.

<ToggleClassButton selector={`section`} classToToggle={`is-busy`} />

```html
<section
  class="is-busyable is-busyable-page"
  data-rb-is-busy-message="This is taking longer than expected…"
  data-rb-is-busy-message-after-seconds="3"
></section>
```
