# Progress & Busy Indicators

## Busy Indicators
Show a busy indicator any time an action takes longer than is reasonable.
Actions that finish in 0.1 seconds are perceived instantaneous.

### "Is Busyable"
The `is-busyable` class is fundamental to using Rocketbelt's busy indicators.
Add it to a container that wraps whatever may be marked as busy. This class
greatly narrows the scope of DOM elements that will be watched by a
`MutationObserver` that shows & hides the indicator. If no element matches
`.is-busyable`, the observer will be registered against `body` (this is an
antipattern and will negatively impact performance).

### Component-Level
<ToggleClassButton selector={`.button:not(.button-copy)`} classToToggle={`is-busy`} />

```html
<button class="button button-primary is-busy is-busy-inverted">Trigger Busy</button>
<button class="button is-busy">Trigger Busy</button>
```

### Page-Level
To mark an entire page (or a very large component) as busy, add both
`is-busyable` and `is-busyable-page` classes. An optional busy message can be
shown by adding a `data-rb-is-busy-message` attribute to the same containing
element. The message will be shown after a configurable delay specified in
data-rb-is-busy-message-after-seconds. (The message will be shown immediately
if this attribute isn't specified.)

<ToggleClassButton selector={`section`} classToToggle={`is-busy`} />

```html
<section class="is-busyable is-busyable-page"></section>
```
