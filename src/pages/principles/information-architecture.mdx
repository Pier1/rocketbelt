# Information Architecture

## What is Information Architecture?
Information architecture is the backbone of a site, the conceptual model used
to structure and build site content and define the relationships among its
content and functionality.

Components of information architecture include:

- Document metadata
- The organization, classification, and labeling of page content
- The hierarchical organization of and relationships between pages within the
  site
- Navigation & search elements that allow a user to find information helpful
  to their goal

Rosenfeld and Morville describe an effective IA as an ecology[^1] that
considers:
- **Users**: The human beings seeking information on the site
- **Context**: A business's goals, resources, and constraints
- **Content**: The types of document and data and their structure

## IA as Minimizer
Well-executed IA minimizes the cost of finding information as well as the impact
of not finding information. It can also minimize the costs of building &
maintaining a site. Most important, a considerate IA elevates the value of a
brand because users can effortlessly find what they're looking for.

## How to Construct an IA
1. Identify company goals
    - Be more specific than "make more money" or "lower our costs"
    - What constraints affect these goals?
2. Identify user goals
    - Conduct user interviews, contextual inquiries, or market research to
      assemble personas and lower assumptions
3. Identify and define content
    - Perform a content inventory to identify everything on the site and audit its
      content to determine its effectiveness
    - What content is missing, duplicative or unclear?
4. Group and label content
    - Card sorts can be run as _open_ or _closed_ activities in which category
      identification is left up to the participants or provided to them. We're
      partial to a _hybrid_ approach in which categories are provided, but can be
      redefined or added to by participants
5. Refine this output into navigation and a site map
6. Test this architecture with users
    - Tree testing: Are the site's category names effective?
    - Card sorting: Should category names be revised?
    - Click testing: How are users attempting to find information?
    - Usability testing: How are users finding information? What do they ignore?
