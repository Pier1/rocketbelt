# Accessibility

> The power of the Web is in its universality. **Access by everyone**
> regardless of disability is an essential aspect.[^1]
> <cite>—Tim Berners-Lee, Creator of the Web</cite>

## Why?
So many reasons. First, the web was created with *universal access* in mind.
Second, "disability" on the web doesn't only mean "uses a screen reader". There
are plenty of sighted users who need accomodation on the web. For instance,
users with:

- Low vision
- Hearing loss
- Inhibited motor function
- Diminished cognitive ability
- Poor color perception

> How many opportunities do we have to dramatically improve people’s lives
> just by doing our job a little better?[^2]
> <cite>—Steve Krug, Author of Don't Make Me Think</cite>

## Accessibility is Usability
Generally speaking, what's good for accessibility is good for usability, and
vice versa.

- A user who is easily distracted benefits from **concise content**
- A user recovering from shoulder surgery benefits from **adequate keyboard
  support**
- A user who has eye strain benefits from **sufficient color contrast**
- A user who wears readers benefits from **text that can scale**

## How Do I Make a Site Accessible?
- Use semantic markup
- Keep accessibility in mind from the start! Reference
  [this helpful cheatsheet](https://moritzgiessmann.de/accessibility-cheatsheet/)
  as you develop
- Use `aria` properties only when necessary
- Learn what the web sounds like for users of screen readers:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OUDV1gqs9GA?start=667" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

## Success Criteria
An accessible page allows a user to…

- Reach all navigation with a keyboard
- Reach all anchors, buttons, and form controls
- Use the enter key to open all links & perform all actions as one would
  with a mouse click
- Understand how to use every form field on a page
- Hear the text equivalent for each image conveying information
