🚀 USABILITY PRINCIPLES (Chemistry, atom, etc.)

1. Research/UCD
2. Accessibility

   6. Cheatsheet
   7. Focus outline (Zeldman quote)
   8. “The one argument for accessibility that doesn’t get made nearly often enough is how extraordinarily better it makes some people’s lives. How many opportunities do we have to dramatically improve people’s lives just by doing our job a little better?” ― Steve Krug DMMT, p.171
   9. “The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.” – Tim Berners-Lee
3. Animation
