# Typography
Well-implemented typography sets the baseline of a site's information
architecture. Use typographic principles to increase a page's scannability

## Accessibility
Always maintain a 4.5:1 or greater contrast ratio between foreground and background text
colors. Additionally, be sure to use adequately heavy font weights to ensure
good legibility.

### Contrast Tools
The [Contrast macOS app](https://usecontrast.com/) comes highly recommended. On
PC, consider The Paciello Group's [Colour Contrast Analyser app](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/).
There are many web-based tools to calculate contrast; the [tool provided by WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
is perhaps the simplest and easiest to use.

## Design for Scannability
People don't read, they scan![^1] Your reader is highly unlikely to pore over
every word on the page. It's imperative that a page is designed with this in
mind and that a page's layout and typography adequately aids a user who will
only scan the content. Methods for achieving that goal follow.

### Heading Levels
Heading tags are commonly used by users of assistive technology to navigate the
document, so using them correctly boosts a page's accessibility.

Separate your page's semantics from its style! Think of the DOM like an outline.
An `h1` should always be followed by an `h2`, an `h2` by an `h3`, and so on.
Never "break rank" and use an improper heading tag just for the size or visual
weight it offers.

### Visual Hierarchy
Establishing a consistent visual hierarchy will help your users quickly make
sense of a page's content.

- **Size & weight** draw the eye and indicate what's important.
- **Positioning** one element above or beside another indicates a relationship
- **Typeface**s can be used to draw contrast between two pieces of content (a label and a definition, for instance)
- **Color** can emphasize or deemphasize a particular piece of text
- **Proximity & similarity** are Gestalt principles that indicate a relationship. For instance:
  - Things that are close to each other ([Proximity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology#Law_of_Proximity)) are likely related
  - Things that look alike ([Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology#Law_of_Similarity)) are likely related

### Line Composition
Aim for a line length of 50-70 characters when possible. Be sure to give ample
line height, especially for sections with a long line length. Rocketbelt's
default line height is 1.5 and only in the rarest case should this value be
lowered.[^2]

## Typeface
[Nunito Sans]{.sans .font-bold} is Rocketbelt's sans serif typeface. The
typeface is a branded element and is likely to change—therefore it's important
that the `font-family` value isn't explicitly declared. Instead, use
Rocketbelt's `font-family` helper function when declaring a `font-family`
property. This ensures that an updated font definition can be used without the
difficulty of changing hundreds or thousands of font declarations.

```scss code-only
font-family: font-family(sans);
```

## Font Sizes
Rocketbelt's font sizes are based on a modular scale in which each step up or
down the scale increases or decreases the font size by the same ratio.

To that end, Rocketbelt provides a `font-size` Sass helper function so that font
sizes don't have to be memorized. **Always use the `font-size` function when
building layouts!**

[`font-size: font-size(-2)`]{.subhead-unlinked} [On a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.
]{.font-minus2}

[`font-size: font-size(-1)`]{.subhead-unlinked} [On a mote of dust suspended in a
sunbeam.]{.font-minus1}

[`font-size: font-size(0)`]{.subhead-unlinked} On a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

[`font-size: font-size(1)`]{.subhead-unlinked} [On a mote of dust suspended in a
sunbeam.]{.font-plus1}

[`font-size: font-size(2)`]{.subhead-unlinked} [On a mote of dust suspended in a
sunbeam.]{.font-plus2}

[`font-size: font-size(3)`]{.subhead-unlinked} [On a mote of dust suspended in a
sunbeam.]{.font-plus3}

## Font Weights
<FontWeightSpecimens typeface="sans" />

## Headings
Use the `heading-style` mixin to create specifically-styled headings. The mixin
requires a SCSS object with `style` and `font-size` keys. The `style` key should
be set to one of the four values below.

```scss code-only
@include heading-style(
  (
    // Match one of the style names below…
    style: 'blurt',
    // Always use the `font-size` function!
    font-size: font-size(2),
  )
);
```

[font-size: font-size(0)]{.subhead-unlinked}
[Whisper]{.heading-styles .whisper}
[Mention]{.heading-styles .mention}
[Blurt]{.heading-styles .blurt}
[Shout]{.heading-styles .shout}

[font-size: font-size(2)]{.subhead-unlinked}
[Whisper]{.heading-styles .whisper .plus2}
[Mention]{.heading-styles .mention .plus2}
[Blurt]{.heading-styles .blurt .plus2}
[Shout]{.heading-styles .shout .plus2}

[font-size: font-size(6)]{.subhead-unlinked}
[Whisper]{.heading-styles .whisper .plus6}
[Mention]{.heading-styles .mention .plus6}
[Blurt]{.heading-styles .blurt .plus6}
[Shout]{.heading-styles .shout .plus6}

## Modifiers
### Ellipses

[Single Line]{.subhead-unlinked}
```html
<div class="ellipsis">
  The fabric that’s as it were salvaged from polyester fabric, our framed piece
  enhances the hidden zipper.
</div>
```

[Multiline]{.subhead-unlinked}
* Manipulate the `-webkit-line-clamp` property to change the number of visible
  lines.
```html
<div class="ellipsis-multiline">
  Look again at that dot. That’s here. That's home. That’s us. On it everyone
  you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who
  ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering,
  thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every
  hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of
  civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother
  and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals,
  every corrupt politician, every “superstar,” every “supreme leader,” every
  saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there—on a mote of dust
  suspended in a sunbeam.
</div>
```

### Text with Icon
Note the use of the `aria-hidden` attribute on the `svg` element. As long as the
text is descriptive—and the icon itself is decorative—`aria-hidden` should be
present.

Use the `icon-left` and `icon-right` classes to indicate icon placement.
```html
<span class="text-with-icon">Store Locator
  <svg class="icon icon-left" aria-hidden>
    <use xlink:href="/icons/rocketbelt.icons.svg#rb-icon-pin"></use>
  </svg>
</span>
<br />
<a class="text-with-icon" href="#">Chat Now
  <svg class="icon icon-right" aria-hidden>
    <use xlink:href="/icons/rocketbelt.icons.svg#rb-icon-chat-single"></use>
  </svg>
</a>
```

### Text with Rule
[Horizontal]{.subhead-unlinked}
```html
<div class="text-with-rule">text with rule</div>
```
