      h2 The "Fold"
      p Yes, it #[i still] matters. Keep in mind that the "fold" varies based on screen height and the content itself isn't as important as the information scent it provides.  If those first items are valuable to a user, then that can be just the impetus necessary to encourage continued scrolling.
      
      h2 User Focus
      div.grid-fluid
        div.row
          div.col.xs
            p Pay attention to how images will steer focus.  In the example animation, the table's angle and the picture perspective will likely cause the user to look at it from top left to bottom right.

            p If the image does it's job and piques a user's interest, then you can insert your content at the exact location to be most effective.

      h2 First &amp; Last Items
      div.grid-fluid
        div.row 
          div.col.xs
            p First items are always considered highest priority by users.  For mission-minded, non-scrollers it may be the one piece of content they see.

            p Items at the bottom of a page full of items will often get an extra boost of attention.  This is called the #[b recency effect] and can be used to your advantage.
