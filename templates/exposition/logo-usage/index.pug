        h2 Logo Guidelines
        p Protecting Pier 1 Imports' identity is important. Communicating with a consistent brand message is important.

        p We have outlined some simple guidelines for the proper usage of our beloved Pier 1 Imports logo:

        ul
            li Do not change the logo.
            li Do not use just a part of the logo.  Don't exclude the the &reg; or the &#8482; symbol.
            li Do not alter the logo by stretching or cropping it.
            li Do not add additional type or art to the logo.
            li Acceptable colors: Pier 1 Imports blue, black, or white.  No others.
            li Acceptable angles: none or 90&deg; (when space is at a premium.)
            li Do not use the logo in a sentence.  Use the words, "Pier 1 Imports."
