          td If the same visual presentation can be made using text alone, an image is not used to present that text.
          td.guidance Avoid embedding meaningful text in images at all costs. If it cannot be avoided, use #[code.font-monospace alt] text or a #[code.font-monospace visually-hidden] element linked with an #[code.font-monospace aria-describedby] attribute on the image.

            span.a11y-principle.navigable Navigable
          td A link is provided to skip navigation and other page elements that are repeated across web pages.

          td The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone, or from the link text and the content that surrounds it.

          td When a page element receives focus, it does not result in a substantial change to the page, the spawning of a pop-up window, an additional change of keyboard focus, or any other change that could confuse or disorient the user.
          td.guidance Allow the user to trigger these states instead. Do not use Javascript to steal keyboard focus.

    h2#skip-links Skip Links
    | Main content or items in a page's footer may require dozens or hundreds Tab presses to interact with if a user is navigating via keyboard. Skip links make this interaction much less tedious by using an on-page href. The link is visually hidden unless it is focused via keyboard.
